# Image Generation Skill

## Overview

This skill generates high-quality images using structured prompts and a Python script. The workflow includes creating JSON-formatted prompts and executing image generation with optional reference images.

## Core Capabilities

- Create structured JSON prompts for AIGC image generation
- Support multiple reference images for style/composition guidance
- Generate images through automated Python script execution
- Handle various image generation scenarios (character design, scenes, products, etc.)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Requirements

When a user requests image generation, identify:

- Subject/content: What should be in the image
- Style preferences: Art style, mood, color palette
- Technical specs: Aspect ratio, composition, lighting
- Reference images: Any images to guide generation
- You don't need to check the folder under `/mnt/user-data`

### Step 2: Create Structured Prompt

Generate a structured JSON file in `/mnt/user-data/workspace/` with naming pattern: `{descriptive-name}.json`

### Step 3: Resolve Thread Context (Required)

This script is thread-bound. Runtime must provide `thread_id` via:
- `CAPYBARA_HOME_THREAD_ID`, or
- `THREAD_ID`

In normal agent runs, these are injected automatically by tool runtime.
If they are missing, fail early with a clear error. Do not use detached generation.

### Step 4: Execute Generation

Call the Python script:
```bash
python /mnt/skills/public/image-generation/scripts/generate.py \
  --prompt-file /mnt/user-data/workspace/prompt-file.json \
  --reference-images /path/to/ref1.jpg /path/to/ref2.png \
  --output-file /mnt/user-data/outputs/generated-image.jpg \
  --aspect-ratio 16:9
```

Parameters:

- `--prompt-file`: Absolute path to JSON prompt file (required)
- `--reference-images`: Absolute paths to reference images (optional, space-separated)
- `--output-file`: Absolute path to output image file hint (required)
- `--aspect-ratio`: Aspect ratio of the generated image (optional, default: 16:9)

[!NOTE]
Do NOT read the python file, just call it with the parameters.

## Character Generation Example

User request: "Create a Tokyo street style woman character in 1990s"

Create prompt file: `/mnt/user-data/workspace/asian-woman.json`
```json
{
  "characters": [{
    "gender": "female",
    "age": "mid-20s",
    "ethnicity": "Japanese",
    "body_type": "slender, elegant",
    "facial_features": "delicate features, expressive eyes, subtle makeup with emphasis on lips, long dark hair partially wet from rain",
    "clothing": "stylish trench coat, designer handbag, high heels, contemporary Tokyo street fashion",
    "accessories": "minimal jewelry, statement earrings, leather handbag",
    "era": "1990s"
  }],
  "negative_prompt": "blurry face, deformed, low quality, overly sharp digital look, oversaturated colors, artificial lighting, studio setting, posed, selfie angle",
  "style": "Leica M11 street photography aesthetic, film-like rendering, natural color palette with slight warmth, bokeh background blur, analog photography feel",
  "composition": "medium shot, rule of thirds, subject slightly off-center, environmental context of Tokyo street visible, shallow depth of field isolating subject",
  "lighting": "neon lights from signs and storefronts, wet pavement reflections, soft ambient city glow, natural street lighting, rim lighting from background neons",
  "color_palette": "muted naturalistic tones, warm skin tones, cool blue and magenta neon accents, desaturated compared to digital photography, film grain texture"
}
```

Execute generation:
```bash
python /mnt/skills/public/image-generation/scripts/generate.py \
  --prompt-file /mnt/user-data/workspace/asian-woman.json \
  --output-file /mnt/user-data/outputs/asian-woman-01.jpg \
  --aspect-ratio 2:3
```

## Common Scenarios

Use different JSON schemas for different scenarios.

**Character Design**:
- Physical attributes (gender, age, ethnicity, body type)
- Facial features and expressions
- Clothing and accessories
- Historical era or setting
- Pose and context

**Scene Generation**:
- Environment description
- Time of day, weather
- Mood and atmosphere
- Focal points and composition

**Product Visualization**:
- Product details and materials
- Lighting setup
- Background and context
- Presentation angle

## Specific Templates

Read the following template file only when matching the user request.

- [Doraemon Comic](templates/doraemon.md)

## Output Handling

After submission:

- The script returns quickly with a `job_id`
- Background poller completes generation and copies the final file into `/mnt/user-data/outputs/capybara/` (or thread output location)
- Completion appears in chat automatically with output path
- You can still iterate by submitting another job

Current behavior note:
- `--reference-images` is currently accepted by CLI for compatibility but not used by the async submission path.

## Notes

- Always use English for prompts regardless of user's language
- JSON format ensures structured, parsable prompts
- Reference-image arguments are accepted by CLI (currently not injected by async submission path)
- Iterative refinement is normal for optimal results
- For character generation, include the detailed character object plus a consolidated prompt field
